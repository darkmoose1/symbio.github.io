                                    I am a New Zealand Trained Registered Nurse. I graduated in 1995 and worked in acute surgical nursing, paediatrics and neonatal intensive care for 12 years. In 2007 I began my appearance medicine nursing career working for a large New Zealand Dermatology, Skin Cancer and Cosmetic clinic.

                                    Over the past 18 years I have accumulated extensive experience in appearance medicine and dermatology nursing, administering a wide range of non-surgical treatment options that rejuvenate the skin. I possess a comprehensive understanding of skin conditions and the aging process. I have a careful and research-based approach to treatments.

                                    When a client walks through my clinic door, I believe they bring their entire self not just their face. I am passionate about creating attractive and authentic results using the highest quality products, while upholding the highest level of ethical standards and client focused care.

                                        Everyone has their own skincare strategies.

After 2 decades of working in the area of skin cancer, the sun is the one common factor that accelerates aging.

                                    BOTOX® is a prescription medicine obtained from the bacterium Clostridium botulinum. It is a natural protein that relaxes muscles in the treatment area leaving the skin smoother and lines minimised.

                                        Safety of BOTOX® (Botulinum-A) for the treatment of glabellar lines was evaluated in two multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group trials (n = 535; 405 in the BOTOX®-treated group and 130 in the placebo-treated group)

                                        Most adverse events reported were of mild to moderate severity and all were transient. The most frequently reported treatment-related adverse events were headache (9.4% in the BOTOX® group and 15.4% in the placebo group) and blepharoptosis (3.2% in the BOTOX® group). Blepharoptosis is consistent with the pharmacological action of BOTOX® and may be injection technique-related

                                        The most common adverse effects of botulinum-A are related to the injection, rather than to the botulinum toxin itself. These adverse effects include pain, bruising, swelling, and redness at the injection site and will resolve within a few days
                                    </span>

                                        An uncommon side-effect of botulinum-A is the unintended weakness of the surrounding muscles (occurring in fewer than 10% of treatments). This weakness results from the spread of the toxin from the injection site into adjacent muscle groups. The eyelids (ptosis), brows, and lips can be affected. This effect is temporary

                                        The effects of your botox treatment will begin to work within 3-5 days and peak at 2 weeks. The effect will gradually wear off over a period of approx 16 weeks/4 months depending on the dose and the area treated. Lower doses used for a more natural look will wear off faster.

                                        Generally fillers last from 9 - 18 mths but research suggests this may be longer. Results depend of a variety of factors including your age, skin quality and facial structure.

                                    Profhilo® is a revolutionary treatment consisting of ultra-pure, highly concentrated Hyaluronic Acid (HA) which is injected beneath the skin.

                                <span>
                                    It is made out of high and low molecular weight HA that have been thermally stabilised without the addition of any chemical cross-linking agents (BDDE chains) making it pure and naturally compatible with our skin. This results in a unique hyaluronic acid injectable gel, which has a prolonged stimulating activity on the dermal cells. When injected into skin, Profhilo® stimulates the skin cell receptors to counteract skin laxity and improve and restore firmness of the skin.

                                Profhilo® not only boosts and hydrates the skin, but also remodels ageing and sagging tissue. The most common areas of treatment include the face and neck and can also be used for the décolletage, hands, arms, knees and abdomen area where it can effectively treat skin laxity.

                                        Profhilo improves your skin quality and slows down skin ageing. It lasts approximately six to nine months in the skin. Bio Remodelling treatments take time to work, and you may not notice an immediate change like you do with dermal fillers. It takes time for the hyaluronic acid to stimulate collagen and elastin production.

                                        Initially you need two treatments spaced one month apart to get the full result. Top ups are generally every six to twelve months. With extensively sun damaged skin other treatments may also be required to achieve optimum results.

Ultra-pure hyaluronic acid is precisely injected into the area being treated. Unlike wrinkle reducing and dermal filler treatments, Profhilo® stimulates collagen and elastin, attracting water in the deeper layers of the skin.

                                    Hyaluronic acid plays a crucial role as activator of biological cascades. Aside from stimulating cell migration and proliferation, in particular fibroblasts, and the production of collagen, which represent the main components of the skin matrix. Hyaluronic acid regulates the skin's immune surveillance through specific interaction with its receptors.
