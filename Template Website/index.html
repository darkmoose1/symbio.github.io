                                    I am a New Zealand Trained Registered Nurse. I graduated in 1995 and worked in acute surgical nursing, paediatrics and neonatal intensive care for 12 years. In 2007 I began my appearance medicine nursing career working for a large New Zealand Dermatology, Skin Cancer and Cosmetic clinic.

                                    Over the past 18 years I have accumulated extensive experience in appearance medicine and dermatology nursing, administering a wide range of non-surgical treatment options that rejuvenate the skin. I possess a comprehensive understanding of skin conditions and the aging process. I have a careful and research-based approach to treatments.

                                    When a client walks through my clinic door, I believe they bring their entire self not just their face. I am passionate about creating attractive and authentic results using the highest quality products, while upholding the highest level of ethical standards and client focused care.

                                    BOTOX® is a prescription medicine obtained from the bacterium Clostridium botulinum. It is a natural protein that relaxes muscles in the treatment area leaving the skin smoother and lines minimised.

                                    Profhilo® is a revolutionary treatment consisting of ultra-pure, highly concentrated Hyaluronic Acid (HA) which is injected beneath the skin.

                            </p>

                                <span>
                                    It is made out of high and low molecular weight HA that have been thermally stabilised without the addition of any chemical cross-linking agents (BDDE chains) making it pure and naturally compatible with our skin. This results in a unique hyaluronic acid injectable gel, which has a prolonged stimulating activity on the dermal cells. When injected into skin, Profhilo® stimulates the skin cell receptors to counteract skin laxity and improve and restore firmness of the skin.

                                Profhilo® not only boosts and hydrates the skin, but also remodels ageing and sagging tissue. The most common areas of treatment include the face and neck and can also be used for the décolletage, hands, arms, knees and abdomen area where it can effectively treat skin laxity.

                                        Our skin naturally contains collagen, elastin and Hyaluronic Acid (HA). HA is the component responsible for retaining moisture and hydrating the skin, which is why it is a common ingredient in serums, moisturisers and eye drops.
                                    </span>
                                </p>

                                    <span>
                                        Skin cells constantly renew and make these substances to maintain the structure of our skin. As we age, it takes longer for us to form these components in the skin, leading to sagging, crepey skin and fine lines.
                                    </span>
                                </p>

                                        Profhilo® acts in two ways. Once injected, it spreads evenly like runny honey under the skin, immediately hydrating the skin. As it integrates into the skin, it stimulates the production of collagen and elastin over a period of 4-6 weeks.
                                    </span>
                                </p>

                                    <span>
                                        The effect is immediate hydration and glow of skin, followed by long-term lifting of saggy skin, reduction of crepey and fine lines, and significant improvement in skin texture and quality.

                                        We can treat any area where there is lax, sagging or wrinkled skin. This is typically the face, neck, decolletage, and back of the hands. For the body, inner arms, inner thighs or just above the knee treatments are popular.

                                        Treatment involves placing tiny injections of the product in specific points (10 points in total) just beneath the skin, using very fine needles. This will feel a little stingy but is usually well tolerated by most people. Topical anaesthetic cream can be offered prior to take the edge of the stinginess. The injection points will be slighty raised (bumpy) after the injections, this often resolves within 30 min, up to 24 hours at the very most.

                                        Profhilo® is very different from traditional dermal fillers.
                                    </span>

                                        It is a highly concentrated Hyaluronic Acid (HA) product (34mg/ml), free of additives, and has the added benefit being a bio-remodelling agent that stimulates collagen and elastin production.
                                    </span>
                                </p>

                                    <span>
                                        It is injected just underneath the skin, and is therefore much safer and associated with less side effects compared to traditional fillers.

                                        It does not volumise the face, like certain dermal fillers. It does not work on muscles unlike other treatments (but these treatments work very well in combination).

                                        Yes. You can have other traditional filler treatments at the same time, though we prefer that these treatments are done in a separate session.

                                        IPL, chemical peels, microdermabrasion should be done two weeks before or after Profhilo® treatment; 4 weeks for Radiofrequency or fractional resurfacing treatments.

                                        Profhilo® is highly biocompatible with our skin, as it is made from ultra-pure Hyaluronic Acid, a substance which is naturally found in our skin, is stabilised without adding chemical cross-linking agents (BDDE chains) and is free of additives. It is therefore very well tolerated, and allergy is rare.

                                        Since its introduction in Italy in 2015 by IBSA, a highly reputable Swiss pharmaceutical company, Profhilo® has been used extensively in Europe and worldwide for the past 7 years. With over a million treatments now administered, there has been no serious adverse effects reported.

                                        After your treatment, you may notice localised, site-specific symptoms which are often short-lasting. This includes swelling, redness, bruising, tenderness, itching, all of which should resolve in 24 - 72 hours.

                                            Vascular Occlusion - this is rare as Profhilo® is injected just underneath the skin. As with any filler, if the product inadvertently enters a blood vessel, there is a risk of skin damage, scarring, blindness or stroke. This is treated by dissolving the filler with Hyalase as soon as the complication is noted.

                                    How Does Profhilo® Work ?
Ultra-pure hyaluronic acid is precisely injected into the area being treated. Unlike wrinkle reducing and dermal filler treatments, Profhilo® stimulates collagen and elastin, attracting water in the deeper layers of the skin.

                                    Hyaluronic acid plays a crucial role as activator of biological cascades. Aside from stimulating cell migration and proliferation, in particular fibroblasts, and the production of collagen, which represent the main components of the skin matrix. Hyaluronic acid regulates the skin's immune surveillance through specific interaction with its receptors.
