                                I am New Zealand Trained Registered Nurse. I graduated in 1995 and worked in acute surgical nursing, paediatrics and neonatal intensive care for 12 years.
                                I began my appearance medicine nursing career in 2007 working for a large medical Dermatology, Skin Cancer and Cosmetic clinic.

                                Over the past 18 years I have accumulated extensive experience in appearance medicine and dermatology nursing, administering a wide range of non-surgical treatment options that rejuvenate skin.
                                I have a comprehensive understanding of the aging process, and a careful and research-based approach to treatments.

                                When a client walks through my clinic door, I believe they bring their entire self not just their face.
                                Using a holistic approach I carefully assist my clients to achieve attractive and authentic results.
                                My warm and compassionate manner, alongside my significant experience make an injectable experience with me a comfortable one.
                                With my expertise I listen to my clients and deliver treatments in a safe and enjoyable environment.
                                I am aware of the ever-changing nature of the appearance medicine industry and understand the need to keep up to date with current trends and research.

                                As with all healthcare professionals ongoing training and education is an important part of my practice.
                                Over the last 18 years I have completed multiple industry-based certifications, trainings,
                                and conferences and have been fortunate to be trained by some of the best and most respected doctors and nurses in the skin industry.

                                    <b>BOTOX®</b> is a prescription medicine obtained from the bacterium Clostridium botulinum. It is a natural protein that relaxes muscles in the treatment area leaving the skin smoother and lines minimised.

                            Dermal Filler treatments may result in some redness, swelling, pain or tenderness, itching or bruising, which may last a few days. Inflammatory reactions can last up to two weeks. Other rare adverse effects may include allergy, infection, granuloma formation, persistent discolouration at the injection site, and ulceration of the skin. Excessive sunlight or extreme cold should be avoided until redness or swelling has resolved. Use with caution before or after laser treatment or chemical peel. Not recommended for pregnant or breastfeeding women. Exposure to excessive sunlight or extreme cold should be avoided until redness or swelling has resolved. If you experience side effects and they concern you, see your healthcare professional. All fillers are FDA approved blah blah blah.

                                    Profhilo® is a revolutionary 'beneath the skin' hyaluronic acid moisturising treatment, made with the patented NAHYCO® technology. This results in a unique hyaluronic acid injectable gel, which has a prolonged stimulating activity on the dermal cells. When injected into skin, Profhilo® stimulates the skin cell receptors to counteract skin laxity and improve and restore firmness of the skin.

                                    Profhilo® not only boosts and hydrates the skin, but also remodels ageing and sagging tissue. The most common areas of treatment include the face and neck and can also be used for the décolletage, hands, arms, knees and abdomen area where it can effectively treat skin laxity.

                            Profhilo® is a revolutionary new treatment consisting of ultra-pure, highly concentrated Hyaluronic Acid (HA) which is injected beneath the skin.

                        <span>
                            It is made out of high and low molecular weight HA that have been thermally stabilised without the addition of any chemical cross-linking agents (BDDE chains), making it pure and naturally compatible with our skin.

                        <span>
                            Our skin naturally contains collagen, elastin and HA. HA is the component responsible for retaining moisture and hydrating the skin, which is why it is a common ingredient in serums, moisturisers and eye drops.
                        </span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span>
                            Skin cells constantly renew and make these substances to maintain the structure of our skin. As we age, it takes longer for us to form these components in the skin, leading to sagging, crepey skin and fine lines.
                        </span>

                        <span>
                            Profhilo® acts in two ways. Once injected, it spreads evenly like runny honey under the skin, immediately hydrating the skin. As it integrates into the skin, it stimulates the production of collagen and elastin over a period of 4-6 weeks.
                        </span>

                            The effect is immediate hydration and glow of skin, followed by long-term lifting of saggy skin, reduction of crepey and fine lines, and significant improvement in skin texture and quality.

                            We can treat any area where there is lax, sagging or wrinkled skin. This is typically the face, neck, decolletage, and back of the hands. For the body, inner arms, inner thighs or just above the knee treatments are popular.

                            Anyone above the age of 30 is eligible for treatment, male or female, and can be used as a preventative treatment once a year before fine lines and sagging forms.

                            Treatment involves placing tiny injections of the product in specific points (10 points in total) just beneath the skin, using very fine needles. This will feel a little stingy but is usually well tolerated by most people. Topical anaesthetic cream can be offered prior to take the edge of the stinginess. The injection points will be slighty raised (bumpy) after the injections, this often resolves within 30 min, up to 24 hours at the very most.

                            Your first appointment takes 45 min and includes an initial consultation. The actual treatment time is 10-15 min. Subsequent appointments will take 20-30 min, to allow time for follow up. If you require local anaesthetic cream, this will take 20-30 min to be effective. Please advise me when you arrive so that we can apply the cream as early as possible.

                            Within a week, you will notice that your skin feels much more hydrated. You may find that you need less moisturiser compared to normal. You will start seeing the best effects of the treatment after THREE months from the first treatment. Treatment effects last 6-9 months. We recommend annual treatments; some people may choose to do a top-up treatment every 6 months.

It is a highly concentrated HA product (34mg/ml), free of additives, and has the added benefit being a bio-remodelling agent that stimulates collagen and elastin production. It is injected just underneath the skin, and is therefore much safer and associated with less side effects compared to traditional fillers. It does not volumise the face, like certain dermal fillers. It does not work on muscles unlike other treatments (but these treatments work very well in combination).

                            Yes. You can have other traditional filler treatments at the same time, though we prefer that these treatments are done in a separate session. IPL, chemical peels, microdermabrasion should be done 2 weeks before or after Profhilo® treatment; 4 weeks for Radiofrequency or fractional resurfacing treatments.

                            Profhilo® is highly biocompatible with our skin, as it is made from ultra-pure Hyaluronic Acid, a substance which is naturally found in our skin, is stabilised without adding chemical cross-linking agents (BDDE chains) and is free of additives. It is therefore very well tolerated, and allergy is rare. Since its introduction in Italy in 2015 by IBSA, a highly reputable Swiss pharmaceutical company, Profhilo® has been used extensively in Europe and worldwide for the past 7 years. With over a million treatments now administered, there has been no serious adverse effects reported.

                            After your treatment, you may notice localised, site-specific symptoms which are often short-lasting. This includes swelling, redness, bruising, tenderness, itching, all of which should resolve in 24 - 72 hours.

                                    Vascular Occlusion - this is rare as Profhilo® is injected just underneath the skin. As with any filler, if the product inadvertently enters a blood vessel, there is a risk of skin damage, scarring, blindness or stroke. This is treated by dissolving the filler with Hyalase as soon as the complication is noted.

                                        In an industry that is often thought of as focused on quick-fix solutions and unachievable, out-of-reach standards of beauty, making informed and correct choices is not always easy for people – especially when it’s not something everyone is open to sharing. Thankfully, there is a better, safer, easier way to get the treatment you really want, completed by medical professionals

                                        How Does Profhilo® Work?
Ultra-pure hyaluronic acid is precisely injected into the area being treated. Unlike wrinkle reducing and dermal filler treatments, Profhilo® stimulates collagen and elastin, attracting water in the deeper layers of the skin.

                                        Hyaluronic acid plays a crucial role as activator of biological cascades. Aside from stimulating cell migration and proliferation, in particular fibroblasts, and the production of collagen, which represent the main components of the skin matrix. Hyaluronic acid regulates the skin's immune surveillance through specific interaction with its receptors.
