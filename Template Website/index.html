                                I am a New Zealand Trained Registered Nurse. I graduated in 1995 and worked in acute surgical nursing, paediatrics and neonatal intensive care for 12 years. In 2007 I began my appearance medicine nursing career working for a large New Zealand Dermatology, Skin Cancer and Cosmetic clinic.

                                Over the past 18 years I have accumulated extensive experience in appearance medicine and dermatology nursing, administering a wide range of non-surgical treatment options that rejuvenate the skin. I possess a comprehensive understanding of skin conditions and the aging process. I have a careful and research-based approach to treatments.

                                When a client walks through my clinic door, I believe they bring their entire self not just their face. I am passionate about creating attractive and authentic results using the highest quality products, while upholding the highest level of ethical standards and client focused care.

Over the last 18 years I have completed multiple industry-based certifications, trainings, and conferences and have been fortunate to be trained by some of the most respected Doctors and Nurses in the cosmetic medicine industry.

                                    ProfhiloÂ® is a revolutionary treatment consisting of ultra-pure, highly concentrated Hyaluronic Acid (HA) which is injected beneath the skin.

                                    It is made out of high and low molecular weight HA that have been thermally stabilised without the addition of any chemical cross-linking agents (BDDE chains), making it pure and naturally compatible with our skin.This results in a unique hyaluronic acid injectable gel, which has a prolonged stimulating activity on the dermal cells. When injected into skin, ProfhiloÂ® stimulates the skin cell receptors to counteract skin laxity and improve and restore firmness of the skin.

                            ProfhiloÂ® not only boosts and hydrates the skin, but also remodels ageing and sagging tissue. The most common areas of treatment include the face and neck and can also be used for the dÃ©colletage, hands, arms, knees and abdomen area where it can effectively treat skin laxity.

Ultra-pure hyaluronic acid is precisely injected into the area being treated. Unlike wrinkle reducing and dermal filler treatments, ProfhiloÂ® stimulates collagen and elastin, attracting water in the deeper layers of the skin.

                                    Hyaluronic acid plays a crucial role as activator of biological cascades. Aside from stimulating cell migration and proliferation, in particular fibroblasts, and the production of collagen, which represent the main components of the skin matrix. Hyaluronic acid regulates the skin's immune surveillance through specific interaction with its receptors.
