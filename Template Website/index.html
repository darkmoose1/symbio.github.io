                                    BOTOX® is a prescription medicine obtained from the bacterium Clostridium botulinum. It is a natural protein that relaxes muscles in the treatment area leaving the skin smoother and lines minimised.

                                    Profhilo® is a revolutionary treatment consisting of ultra-pure, highly concentrated Hyaluronic Acid (HA) which is injected beneath the skin.

                                    It is made out of high and low molecular weight HA that have been thermally stabilised without the addition of any chemical cross-linking agents (BDDE chains), making it pure and naturally compatible with our skin.This results in a unique hyaluronic acid injectable gel, which has a prolonged stimulating activity on the dermal cells. When injected into skin, Profhilo® stimulates the skin cell receptors to counteract skin laxity and improve and restore firmness of the skin.

                                Profhilo® not only boosts and hydrates the skin, but also remodels ageing and sagging tissue. The most common areas of treatment include the face and neck and can also be used for the décolletage, hands, arms, knees and abdomen area where it can effectively treat skin laxity.

                                        Our skin naturally contains collagen, elastin and HA. HA is the component responsible for retaining moisture and hydrating the skin, which is why it is a common ingredient in serums, moisturisers and eye drops.

                                        Skin cells constantly renew and make these substances to maintain the structure of our skin. As we age, it takes longer for us to form these components in the skin, leading to sagging, crepey skin and fine lines.

                                        Profhilo® acts in two ways. Once injected, it spreads evenly like runny honey under the skin, immediately hydrating the skin. As it integrates into the skin, it stimulates the production of collagen and elastin over a period of 4-6 weeks.

                                        The effect is immediate hydration and glow of skin, followed by long-term lifting of saggy skin, reduction of crepey and fine lines, and significant improvement in skin texture and quality.

                                        Treatment involves placing tiny injections of the product in specific points (10 points in total) just beneath the skin, using very fine needles. This will feel a little stingy but is usually well tolerated by most people. Topical anaesthetic cream can be offered prior to take the edge of the stinginess. The injection points will be slighty raised (bumpy) after the injections, this often resolves within 30 min, up to 24 hours at the very most.

                                        It is a highly concentrated HA product (34mg/ml), free of additives, and has the added benefit being a bio-remodelling agent that stimulates collagen and elastin production.

                                        Yes. You can have other traditional filler treatments at the same time, though we prefer that these treatments are done in a separate session.

                                        Profhilo® is highly biocompatible with our skin, as it is made from ultra-pure Hyaluronic Acid, a substance which is naturally found in our skin, is stabilised without adding chemical cross-linking agents (BDDE chains) and is free of additives. It is therefore very well tolerated, and allergy is rare.

                                        Since its introduction in Italy in 2015 by IBSA, a highly reputable Swiss pharmaceutical company, Profhilo® has been used extensively in Europe and worldwide for the past 7 years. With over a million treatments now administered, there has been no serious adverse effects reported.

                                        After your treatment, you may notice localised, site-specific symptoms which are often short-lasting. This includes swelling, redness, bruising, tenderness, itching, all of which should resolve in 24 - 72 hours.

As with any filler, if the product inadvertently enters a blood vessel, there is a risk of skin damage, scarring, blindness or stroke. This is treated by dissolving the filler with Hyalase as soon as the complication is noted.

                                    How Does Profhilo® Work?
Ultra-pure hyaluronic acid is precisely injected into the area being treated. Unlike wrinkle reducing and dermal filler treatments, Profhilo® stimulates collagen and elastin, attracting water in the deeper layers of the skin.

                                    Hyaluronic acid plays a crucial role as activator of biological cascades. Aside from stimulating cell migration and proliferation, in particular fibroblasts, and the production of collagen, which represent the main components of the skin matrix. Hyaluronic acid regulates the skin's immune surveillance through specific interaction with its receptors.
